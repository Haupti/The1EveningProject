# The1EveningProject
I made this together with and for a friend in one evening

## What it is
This is a little script project that helps my friend Lukas to make his shopping list.
He spend at least two hours a week with making food plans for the week and then 
converting the plan into a shopping list for the week. 
He therefor thought he might ask me for help to find a quick solution that can be 
coded in one evening. So we made this.
I know that this contains a lot of hardcoded object initializations which should be done in a better way.
This, however, would take more time, and he especially wanted to be able to add recipes and ingredients by hand in
a clear organized way without any command prompt or graphical user interface (last of which because it would take too much time).

## What it do
You can define a food plan for a week by hardcoding it into the corresponding file. You then run the script, which
makes a PDF shopping list in a order desired. This order preferably is given by the order the goods are distributed in your
local supermarket.
